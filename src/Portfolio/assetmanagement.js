            Asset management is a systematic approach to the governance and realization of values. It requires establishment, implementation, operation, maintenance and improvement of management. This need has been identified and Standards have been issued by ISO. The latest version has been issued as ISO 55000-2024.
            To maximize Asset Sweating a structured approach right from Cradle ( Project conceptualization) to Grave ( Asset Disposal)  is required as it involves various stakeholders from Engineering to Operations Finance and many more.
            Each organization has some uniqueness due to its Values, Mission, Approach  Size, and Operation. So, the same methodology canâ€™t be implemented for all and needs to be tweaked to suit your organization.
